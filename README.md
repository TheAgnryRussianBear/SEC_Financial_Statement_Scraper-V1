# SEC_Financial_Statement_Scraper-V1
The goal of this project is to create a program to pull financial statements from the SEC website. Ideally, most of the process will be automatic. I am completely new to coding and am using this first project as a way to learn. I have no formal education in coding so I appologize in advance if my coding is sloppy and inefficient. Any and all constructive feedback is welcome.
